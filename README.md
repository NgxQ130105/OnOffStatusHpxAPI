#OnOffStatusHpxAPI

Something about it:
- The very foundation of an Automated Online Status Checking script for Hypixel Minecraft Server.
- I don't mind you stealing it cuz it goes open-source ,and also i stole this from the others too lol 
- Whether you chose to notify using the script in any mini game in Hypixel, it all works. I have come up with the idea of implementing more codes so it is usable as a Discord bot but I'm not so sure if i'm able to upload it anytime soon! Feel free to watch or star it if you want lol

Usage: 
- As long as you are in the Hypixel Network Server it will run non-stoppably until you are disconnected due to the lack of Internet connection or force kick from server side client (This is useful for AFK Farming, AFK mini game xp, and tons of other things)

How to use:
- Do /api new in Hypixel server to get the new API, replace the old with the new one
- Inputing your username instead mine (z3r0o2)
- Click the "run" button to execute the code. It will ONLY notify you if you are disconnected through the Terminal or else it will show nothing!
